# Letras Simulation

This is a simulation for the second stage of the Tour de Friends IV, including Alto de Letras, the longest UCI climb in this world.

It can basically be used for any GPX files, though there are some hard coded values specific for Columbia and me.

## Functionality

* Calculating the time for specific power inputs
* Calulating when the rider is where and displaying it nicely
